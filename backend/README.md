This directory contains all the files required for the virtual environment to work properly.
To activate the virtualenv, from the `backend` directory, run:

```
$ source bin/activate
```

(If using an alternative shell, scripts are available for fish and csh.
The standard script works for zsh as well as bash.)

When finished, run:

```
$ deactivate
```
